# Python Projects

## Practice projects I wrote as I learned to charm the snake!

#### This repository contains guided projects that I wrote while doing the Tech Academy Software Development Bootcamp! This program has been a wonderful growth opportunity for me. It's been a privilege to be able to learn from such a well-structured course.

### Notable Projects in This Repository:

## [dayOldSorter.py](https://github.com/MeisterKeen/Python-Projects/blob/main/dayOldSorter.py)

#### This was the first time I had to solve a problem by writing my own code in Python. This proved my ability to work with if/else statements and for loops, and to be able to look up documentation on unfamiliar modules in order to work out my own implementations to solve problems.

## [Django Checkbook Project](https://github.com/MeisterKeen/Python-Projects/tree/main/Django_Projects/Django_Checkbook)

#### This was a guided coding project that helped me grasp the basics of Django. Wonderfully powerful but a bit obtuse when first learning, Django required me to really stretch my ability to think with a lot of dependencies and systems working in tandem. Everything references everything else, but a few lines of reusable code can accomplish powerful things in such a framework. I didn't like Django at first, but now I'm rather impressed with it.

## [runningPyNotes.py](https://github.com/MeisterKeen/Python-Projects/blob/main/runningPythonNotes.py)

#### This long, messy document is actually a record of the notes that I took during my course. It's only here because it shows me how far I've come.
