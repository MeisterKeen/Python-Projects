# Python Projects

## Practice projects I wrote as I learned to charm the snake!

#### This repository contains guided projects that I wrote while doing the Tech Academy Software Development Bootcamp! This program has been a wonderful growth opportunity for me. It's been a privilege to be able to learn from such a well-structured course.

### Notable Projects in This Repository:

## [dayOldSorter.py](https://github.com/MeisterKeen/Python-Projects/blob/main/dayOldSorter.py)

#### This was the first time I had to solve a problem by writing my own code in Python. This proved my ability to work with if/else statements and for loops, and to be able to look up documentation on unfamiliar modules and work out my own implementations to solve problems.
